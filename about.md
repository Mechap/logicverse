title: About
---

I'm a undergraduate student in mathematics at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France. In my
copious free time[^1] I like to hack on free software especially anything
involving GNU/Linux, ride my bike around, or watch classic movies.

My work can broadly be characterized under the terms "constructive mathematics".
In particular, as you may have already noticed by reading some articles here, I
like thinking about type systems, logic variants, and proof assistants.

Most of the time I'm fastest to reply via E-Mail, but you can try any of the
following channels:
